🎣 Pay To Fish – Web Application for Fishing Venue Management

Pay To Fish is a modern web application designed to support the operations of a commercial fishing venue, while also catering to fishing enthusiasts looking for a simple and intuitive platform to plan trips, share their catches, and stay informed about angling news.

Users can register or log in with Google, and conveniently book fishing spots with flexible date selection and automatic cost calculation. Their personal dashboard allows them to manage, review, and edit their reservation history with ease. The app also includes a social feed where users can share fishing reports, edit or delete their posts, and interact with the community — all through a clean and user-friendly interface.

A dedicated blog section provides engaging content and updates from the fishing world, while a contact form ensures smooth communication with site administrators.
